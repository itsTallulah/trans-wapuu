# trans-wapuu
The gender-y Wapuu who looks after eggs.

It's March 30th 2021, it's Trans Day of Visibility tomorrow, and most of computer-y humanity has been cooped up indoors. As a trans woman in tech and in WordPress and in tumultuous times for trans rights, I'm not feeling particularly visible, so I made a Wapuu that represents how I feel about my community and my trans siblings right now.

Their name is simply `Trans Wapuu`, their pronouns are `they/them` and their gender is `nobody's business but their own`.

I make one (1) extremely loose promise to vector this up one day so it's not so jagged. You're welcome to beat me to it. Bonus: Wallpaper!

Trans Rights are Human Rights
