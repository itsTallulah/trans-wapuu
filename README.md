# trans-wapuu
The gender-y Wapuu who looks after eggs.

It's March 30th 2021, it's Trans Day of Visibility tomorrow, and most of humanity has been cooped up indoors. As a trans woman in tech and in WordPress and in tumultuous times for trans rights, I'm not feeling particularly visible, so I made a Wapuu that represents how I feel about my communnity and my trans siblings right now.

Their name is simply `Trans Wapuu`, their pronouns are they/them and their gender is nobody's business but their own.

I made them from the original Wapuu in Clip Studio Paint on a MS Surface Go because heck yeah CSP so here's a .csp file and some jpgs and pngs and okay fine I'll save a .psd but no fidelity promises.

I make one (a) extremely loose promise to vector this up one day so it's not so jagged.

Trans Rights are Human Rights
